                <h2>Vegan Gingerbread Latte</h2>
           
                 <p>
                Cold weather is tolerable because of all things that make it cozy: comfy sweaters, warm blankets, and warm drinks.</p>
                <p> Oh, the warm drinks! This gingerbread latte - while often enjoyed during the holiday season - can certainly be enjoyed year-round, and feels just like a hug in a mug.The mixture of lentils, chopped walnuts, and sunflower seeds help to bulk up the salad, making it a hearty meal choice for warm summers when you couldn't be bothered to cook anything that might heat up the kitchen. </p>
               

                <h2>Directions</h2>
                  <p>1.Add the barista milk to a saucepan on high heat. Whisk throughout to create some froth. Stay with it, as it often only needs a minute to heat through. When the milk starts to simmer, remove the pan from the heat and pour it into your desired mugs.</p>
                    <p>2.Return the saucepan to the stove on medium heat, adding in the espresso together with the maple syrup, molasses, cinnamon, ginger, nutmeg, and clove. We added 2 shots of espresso per cup, but feel free to add less espresso if preferred. Then whisk to combine all the spices and to let everything heat through. Divide the spiced espresso between your mugs.</p>
                    <p>3.Top with whipped cream and cookie crumbles, if desired. Serve while hot, and enjoy! </p>

                      <p><B>Notes</B></p>
                         <p>1.* Barista milk often has a higher proportion of fat and carbohydrates than other plant-based milk, which gives it a nice creamy mouthfeel. This is our preferred plant-based milk for lattes</p>
                             <p>2.** Blackstrap molasses is a dark, thick, often bitter syrup, which is produced during the sugar making process. During this process, the sugar beets or sugar cane are crushed, to extract the juice. Then, the juice is boiled down to sugar crystals, and removed from the liquid.</p>
                              <p>3.This process is repeated several times, and every time a different kind of molasses is produced, from light to black. Blackstrap molasses comes from the third boiling of the sugar syrup and has the highest concentration of vitamins and minerals. Molasses pairs very well with ginger, which is why it's commonly used in gingerbread cookies, and also in this gingerbread drink. You can also substitute it with 1 Tbsp (15 mL) dark corn syrup, or maple syrup, or ¾ Tbsp (9 g) packed brown sugar or granulated sugar.</p>

                                    Best if enjoyed immediately.
